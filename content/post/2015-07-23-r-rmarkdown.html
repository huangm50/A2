<h1>Executive summary</h1>
<div id="objective-of-the-study" class="section level2">
<h2>Objective of the study</h2>
<p>Petit Poll has been asked by the Liberal Party and a team consists of Michelle Huang, Chenxuan Ding, Yantong Li and Zuzhang Zhao to survey election pattern in Ontario for the upcoming Canadian Election. We would like to investigate how the diﬀerence in people’s attributes (age, previous voting etc.) could inﬂuence the election results.</p>
</div>
<div id="impletemetation-on-the-study" class="section level2">
<h2>Impletemetation on the study</h2>
<p>We surveyed 5000 people and recorded their answered surveyed data to analyze the data. We created a survey that would eventually go to the 5000 registered household owners living in Ontario in the government database using SurveyMonkey website. We asked various questions with some of the variables of interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="discovery-of-the-study" class="section level2">
<h2>Discovery of the study</h2>
<p>We found that the election results i.e. the party that each individual actually voted for can be greatly inﬂuenced by that individual’s age group and the past voting experience of whether they voted before or not. These two variables were included in the survey questionnaire and other questions in the survey questionnaire includes the current status in Canada and their personal interest on voting.</p>
</div>
<div id="two-examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Two examples</h2>
<p>We hypothesized that the diﬀerent people with diﬀerent status in Canada may have diﬀerent interests on voting, which result in diﬀerent vote results.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For instance, permanent residents or Canadian citizen may pay much more attention to the election results compared that to group of people with study or work permit since the future due to the election results would have a much more signiﬁcant impact for permanent residents or Canadian citizen. Furthermore, the diﬀerence in political direction or opinions from each election candidates also have an inﬂuence on the mentioned variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Another example is that if the election candidate cared very much about domestic elderly welfare, the permanent residents or Canadian citizen at an upper year group may vote for the party that this speciﬁc election candidate is in. Another example could be, one election candidate promotes to release the ﬁnancial burden for student loans for international students, it will become obvious the party of this election candidate would be voted by the group of people with younger year group that have current status with study permit.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="meaning-and-use-of-the-study" class="section level2">
<h2>Meaning and use of the study</h2>
<p>This survey could provide us with a great amount of insights on why people vote for certain party and let us to understand the pattern behind the scene by a data-driven procedure. This also allows us to provide the Liberal Party, in this case our client to understand the way how they could have a larger chance to be elected.</p>
</div>
<div id="weakness-and-next-step" class="section level2">
<h2>Weakness and next step</h2>
<p>The complicated interaction between each variable could introduce unreliability and uncertainty to our analysis, the next step could be rigorous modeling buildings and assumption checking of any correlation between each variable. And any lurking variables or confounding variables could be deeply investigated for any bias in our study.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The question we are interested in is that what potential variables could aﬀect the Canadian election results and ﬁnd out how much the eﬀect could be, especially considering the voters for the Liberal Party. We created a survey that would eventually go to the 5000 registered household owners living in Ontario in the government database using SurveyMonkey website. We asked various questions with some of the variables of interest. We will collected the data and analyse them to draw the conclusion in the ﬁnal report.</p>

<h2>Survey methodology</h2>
<p>Population frame and sample Population
- All the household owners living in Ontario.</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling-frame" class="section level2">
<h2>Sampling frame</h2>
<ul>
<li>A list of 5000 registered household owners living in Ontario who answered the survey questionnaires.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sample" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample</h2>
<ul>
<li>5000 registered household owners people living in Ontario.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="desired-respondents-acquisition" class="section level2">
<h2>Desired respondents acquisition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send the link of the web survey to the phone number to the registered household owners living in Ontario.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="survey-cost-estimation" class="section level2">
<h2>Survey cost estimation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>$(15 + 0.1) * 5000 + ﬁx cost of survey design</p></li>
<li><p>Starbucks gift card of $15 value</p></li>
<li><p>Text fee $0.1 for sending the survey website link</p></li>
<li><p>The total cost of the survey could be high due to the fact that we need to provide people completed the survey with incentive of gift cards, whereas the actual cost due to the survey logistics is not too much, only $0.1 of text fee</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="non-response-and-its-effect-on-survey" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-response and its effect on survey</h2>
<ul>
<li>For each of response, give them starbucks gift card of $15 value. By doing this, we have some incentive for the people to do the survey. The group of people who are not quite interested in voting or do not care about election at all may be the non-response.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="respondent-privacy-protection" class="section level2">
<h2>Respondent privacy Protection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send the web link with some built-in privacy protocols which require ﬁlling in some personal information and conﬁrming the individual before the survey starts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="sampling-methods-and-statistical-properties" class="section level2">
<h2>Sampling methods and statistical properties</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I will use SRSWOR Sampling since this the most straightforward method and can avoid any potential variables causing bias in the results.</p></li>
<li><p>I will not choose SRSWOR stratiﬁed or clustered at ﬁrst since we do not know whether each group or each individual could be representative for the whole population.</p></li>

<h1>Age vs Past Voting Experience</h1>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" />
We can clearly see that older people tends to have more voting experience before. So, we may be interested in how much of diﬀerence the age made on the past voting experience by calculating the mean and standard deviations of the two diﬀerence groups of with or without past voting experiences.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 3
##   vote_before mean_age median_age
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 No              25.2       25.0
## 2 Yes             44.8       44.8</code></pre>
<p>We can see that people without any voting experience on average is around 25 whereas people with voting experience on average is around 45, there is 20 years old of diﬀerence.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From this graph, we could see that the diﬀerence between past voting experience is much more signiﬁcant than the diﬀerent parties people vote. In other words, the group we use should be the past voting experience instead of what they vote for.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the ﬁrst vote distribution plot of votes for three diﬀerent parties voted, we could observe that for people without any voting experience vote others the most while people vote for Conservative Party the most for people with past voting experience.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><img src="/post/2015-07-23-r-rmarkdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   vote               mean_age median_age
##   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Conservative Party     38.7       39.9
## 2 Liberal Party          35.6       31.9
## 3 Others                 31.9       27.3</code></pre>
<p>From the second plot, we could see that people vote for Conservative Party are on average the older people whereas young people tend to vote for others maybe due to that they are not interested in voting.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>From the analysis we performed, we determine that the past experience of voting may impact the ﬁnal results. The result of voting on the other hand may large impacted by the age groups as well since we found a quite large diﬀerences of results for diﬀerence age groups. This diﬀerence may be explained by the fact that the younger people are generally lacking of experience on voting in the past and may be not interesting in voting at all. On the other hand, older people tends to have much more experience on voting and would be interested in voting.</p>
</div>
<div id="weakness-and-areas-for-future" class="section level1">
<h1>Weakness and areas for future</h1>
<p>There are some weakness including lacking of the source of data accuracy. Since we used the simulation based on the past census data from the website, the data could be outdated and some variables may lack of data scource at all. This results in inaccuracy of the simulation and not be able to recreate a real world scenario.</p>
